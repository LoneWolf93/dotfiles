# What is Dotfiles?
Dotfiles are plain text configuration files on Unix-y systems for things like our shell, `~/.zshrc`, our editor in `~/.vimrc`, and many others. They are called "dotfiles" as they typically are named with a leading . making them hidden files on your system, although this is not a strict requirement.

Since these files are all plain text, we can gather them together in a git repository and use that to track the changes you make over time.

# Important
Some programs needs to be installed for the correct run of `~/.spectrwm.conf`. You can comment that lines if you want it.

### Example
```
program[lock]		= i3lock

program[term]		= urxvt

program[menu]		= rofi -show drun -font 'Terminus Bold 11'
```
